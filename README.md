# osu-ds

An attempt to revive this ancient piece of DS homebrew because it looked cool.

# Usage

osu-ds uses a special .ods file format instead of the standard .osu format for beatmaps. [A converter is being made.](https://github.com/KonPet/osu-ds-convert)

# Building

Builds on the latest version of devkitARM (with no warnings!).  
**NOTE**: Despite building successfully, trying to run the built .nds file does not work. It whitescreens on DeSmuME and crashes on no$gba. 

# Original Readme

As part of an effort to open source the full osu! stack, I (peppy) am splitting out ports which are currently stored in the monolithic git repository. This is a NDS port made by Echo which was developed to a basic working state. Keep in mind that the last changes were made in 2009 and therefore it may not work with newer maps.
