osu-ds
======

As part of an effort to open source the full osu! stack, I (peppy) am splitting out ports which are currently stored in the monolithic git repository. This is a NDS port made by echo which was developed to a basic working state. Keep in mind that the last changes were made in 2009 and therefore it may not work with newer maps.
